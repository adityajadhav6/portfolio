## Overview

A visually appealing restaurant table management system that lets hotel staff assign tables, take orders, and generate bills from a floor layout UI.

## Key Features

- **Visual Table Layout**: Tables represented graphically with color-coded statuses.
- **Order Modals**: Add, update, or delete orders for any table.
- **Billing System**: Auto-calculates totals, GST, and generates a paper-style printable bill.
- **Waiter Assignment**: Easily assign and track waiter responsibilities per table.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend logic and UI interactions.
- **Node.js & Express**: Backend for handling order, table, and billing logic.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing order and table data.

## Challenges and Learnings

Creating a responsive and realistic UI for various table shapes (round/rectangular) with proper alignment and user-friendly controls was tricky but rewarding.

## Outcome

Enabled restaurant managers to fully operate the system without coding. It reduced confusion during peak hours and improved staff efficiency.
