## Overview

Developed a robust backend authentication system to handle user registration, login, and profile management. The system uses JWT-based authentication for secure access to protected routes and ensures password security with bcrypt hashing.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure endpoints for creating and authenticating user accounts.
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens for secure access control.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based access to sensitive user data with middleware validation.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses for invalid inputs and unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to manage schemas and queries.
- **bcrypt.js**: For hashing and verifying passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Token Expiry Management**: Implemented token expiration to enhance security and prevent misuse.
- **Database Schema Design**: Designed a scalable schema to handle user data efficiently.
- **Middleware Optimization**: Created reusable middleware for token validation and error handling.

## Outcome

The system provides a secure and scalable solution for user authentication, suitable for integration into larger applications. It ensures data security and simplifies user management for developers.
