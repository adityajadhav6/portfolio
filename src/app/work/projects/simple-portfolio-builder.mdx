## Overview

This project offers a scalable and secure healthcare platform, integrating EHRs, remote consultation, and machine learning analytics.

## Key Features

- **EHR Storage**: Secure, encrypted electronic health records.
- **Telehealth Support**: Built-in video consultation capabilities.
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models forecast patient health risks based on historical data.
- **Role-based Access**: Patients, doctors, and admins have separate access with JWT-secured sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Responsive UI and dashboard components.
- **Node.js & Express**: API layer and business logic.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL DB for flexible patient data.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for training and deploying ML models.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.

## Challenges and Learnings

Ensuring data privacy and system security across multiple roles while integrating Python ML models with a JavaScript-based backend posed technical and architectural challenges.

## Outcome

The platform improves patient care through proactive monitoring and provides healthcare providers a unified view of records and predictions. It can be deployed on any major cloud platform.
