## Overview

Developed and maintained a web-based system for managing Doctorates, Supervisors, and Advisory Committee records efficiently using PHP and MySQL.

## Key Features

- **Admin and Viewer Modules**: Separate dashboards for admins and viewers to ensure secure, role-based access.
- **Full CRUD Support**: Streamlined data operations for managing academic records.
- **User-Centric UI**: Intuitive interface for academic staff and administration.
- **Database Optimization**: Well-structured schema for high performance and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting for backend logic.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for structured academic data.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive layout design.

## Challenges and Learnings

Faced complexity in creating relational joins across entities like supervisors and doctorates. Addressed this by carefully normalizing the schema and using secure access control mechanisms.

## Outcome

The system improved data traceability and made record keeping easier for academic institutions, saving manual labor and time.
